# SmartRGBv2-Audio
Reads your computer audio, and streams color data to the SmartRGBv2 controller.

# Disclaimer: Very bad
I literally just copied some example code and added one function. I don't know anything about the Win32 API nor the WASAPI. This is bad, but it kinda works, so I'm not spending much time on it.
